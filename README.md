# Marc Torres

Responsible of QA. 
I used Github Issues frequently in order to know what bugs the game has had during the production. You can check this information [here](https://github.com/BooLAW/Zelda-Project/issues).

I also create a QA plan at the beginning of the production. Check it out [here](https://github.com/BooLAW/Zelda-Project/wiki/QA)

## What I Have Done

I coded the base of the module player.

Then I started designing a lot of puzzles for the game, you can check some of them on the GDD. 
A part of design them, I code the block entities despite at the end we didn't use it.
It consisted of different blocks with different functionalities in order to achieve what I designed previously.

I also did the following animations: Pickup, Throw, Pull & Shield Walk
